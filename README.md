# core-ui

Comindware Core UI is a set of components based on Marionette framework and some other third-party libraries. Built in the best tradition of Marionette, it allows you to create complex modular UI by nesting powerful ready-to-use components.

The package includes a variety of components such as editors, lists, dropdowns, as well as several high-level services to build pop-ups, show messages, arrange RPC-ajax communication and localize the application.

For more details look at the [documentation](https://comindware.github.io/core-ui/doc/index.html) and try out the [demo](https://comindware.github.io/core-ui/demo/index.html).
